                    <strong>Sparks Bank</strong> allows a user to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.
                    Sparks Bank offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of online banking, available both on desktop versions and through mobile apps.
                    With Sparks Bank, consumers aren't required to visit a bank branch to complete most of their basic banking transactions. They can do all of this at their own convenience, wherever they wantâ€”at home, at work, or on the go.
                    Sparks Bank requires a computer or other device, an Internet connection, and a bank or debit card. In order to access the service, clients need to register for their bank's online banking service. In order to register, they need to create a password. Once that's done, they can use the service to do all their banking.
                    Banking transactions offered online vary by the institution. Most banks generally offer basic services such as transfers and bill payments. Some banks also allow customers to open up new accounts and apply for credit cards through online banking portals. Other functions may include ordering checks, putting stop payments on checks, or reporting a change of address.
